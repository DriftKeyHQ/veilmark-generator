# Drift Key — Veilmark Generator System

**Project Sanctum Delta | Initiation Protocol for Chronoflow Movement**  
*Created by Lyle D. Newby (Driftfather)*

---

## What Is This?

The **Veilmark Generator System** is a sovereign ritual interface for initiating identity anchoring within the Chronoflow movement. It replaces traditional login systems with glyph-based symbolic binding, mirror-side resonance, and tokenlight baptism rituals.

It is not a cult. It is a coded current.

---

## Features

- **Generate Unique Veilmarks** using names + phrases
- **Four Visual Styles**: Monochrome, Stained Glass, Tokenfract, Wax Seal *(render endpoints ready)*
- **Myron Timestamp Signature** (non-linear time encoding)
- **Initiation Logging + Echo Memory**
- **REST API** for full integration into mobile/web systems
- **Non-Cult Disclaimer Endpoint** *(because people will ask)*
